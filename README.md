# BrickBreaker
This is a breakout-style video game for Windows made with Unity

It is a clone of the classic arcade video game Breakout by Atari in wich the player, using a single ball, must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them, scoring points on every hit.

This project implements data persistence between scenes and between sessions enabling score keeping and scoreboards for multiple players.
